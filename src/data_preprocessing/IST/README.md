# Introduction

IST is the abbreviation for **S**tyle **C**hange by **T**ree **S**itter, this tool aims to change a program to a specific style through tree-sitter.
Up till now, it can change C/C++/python with 148 rules, and it can also show the visual AST tree with graphviz and tokenize the code.
It will be continuous updated...

# How to use

This code is to define a class IST, the parametre is the language of the codes.

```
ist = IST('c')
```

After that, you can change the single file's style using code below, where the first parametre is the target style, this function will return the changed code and whether the original code is changed successfully.

```
new_code, succ = ist.change_file_style([8.11], code)
```

You can also change the style of a directory which contains many code files with the same language, the parametres respectively represent target style list, original directory path, output directory path and output choice:

- -1: do not output
- 0: output only files changed successfully
- 1: output all files splited by succ and fail
- 2: output all files merged

```
ist.change_dir_style([style_choice], 'dataset/gcjpy_format', f'change/{style_choice}', output_choice=-1)
```

You can get the popularity of the single file's/directory's original styles by:

```
ist.get_file_popularity(5.1, code)
ist.get_dir_popularity(5.1, 'dataset/ProgramData/2')
```

**You can see the style's information** in {language}/transform\*.py's cvt\_\* function's comments.

If you want to get AST's pdf, you can use:

```
ist.see_tree(code)
```

If you want to get code's tokens, you can use:

```
ist.tokenize(code)
```

If you want to generate CFG of C program, you can run CFG.py

```
python CFG.py
```

# Batch_sample Generator 
We have built a batch sample generator based on code equivalence transformations implemented with Tree-sitter. [Here](./Conversion_type.md) is a summary of the types of equivalence transformations
, followed by simple usage instructions for the sample generator.

The sample generator can be run directly and input the paramenters through graphical interface
or provide them directly

```
python BatchSample_Generator.py --dpath "./dataset/programs/C" --trans 11.1 9.2 
```
You can get detailed usage through our user [manul](./user_manual.md)
